Performance Notes

Issues[Update Board]~
Name Conventions; Revised Create Table statements; having duplicate Attribute names for IDs/Name could lead to confusion so I've renamed each set to be relevant to the Table they are in.
FK; Added Foreign Key Column names in each create table statement for indexing purposes later.
FK; Each FK column Starts with the Table name it comes from for reading ease.
Table view displays; When creating views change appearence of column headings to be user-friendly. i.e. not Eqi_Cat but "Equipment Category".


--------------------------------------------------------
- Table Specific Alterations:-

Department
1.Moved Floor & Ward to Hospital as they should be parented by Hospital not Dept.
2.Will Join Dept to Hospital via Floor, ward. [Need to check whether joins need to have both columns created in both tables]
3.Hosp_ID will be FK.

Equipment
1.Possible composite key with Id & Barcode.
2.Added Equi_Pers (Equipment|Person) for FK
3.Added Equi_Dept (Equipment|Department) for FK
4.Added Equi_Main_Last_Cleaned (Equipment|Maintenance) for FK

IDs
1.Added User_Pass to table.
2.Need to research encryption for password storage.

1. If trigger is successful, may not need User table so no amendments at present
----------------------------------------------------------
